# PulserHandwheel

Small project to read pulser handwheel with attachInterrupt() function.

Fast back and forth rotations did cause some lost steps, but fast one direction rotation didin't make it lose steps.
At least  when i tested it.

Remember to check which pins on your arduino are usable for interrupts.
